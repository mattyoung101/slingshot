# Slingshot C++
This is the C++ side of Slingshot. It deals with interacting with the Slang SystemVerilog parser and passing results
back to the main Rust binary.

This project uses C++20 and CMake, so you will need a recent version of both gcc/clang and CMake. I
personally compile with Clang 15. It is not regularly tested under gcc, but should work as well.
