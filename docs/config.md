# Slingshot configuration

## .slingshot.yaml
Slingshot configuration is loaded from a file canonically called `.slingshot.yaml` 
(also acceptably `.slingshot.yml`) in the root directory of the project. The project root directory 
is usually the Git root directory, so the top of your Git repo. However, this is decided by the 
LSP client, so it depends on how that is configured.

The current `.slingshot.yaml` format looks as follows:

```yaml
# Slingshot SystemVerilog language server configuration file
# https://github.com/mattyoung101/slingshot

# Config file version
version: "1.0.0"

# List of include directories, relative to project root, to search for SystemVerilog files.
# Note: The project root directory is usually the Git root directory.
# This option is used to configure Verilator linting, to resolve `include directives, and to index
# multi-file projects, so it's very important that this is correct and kept up to date.
includeDirs:
  - "rtl"
  # ... any other RTL source directories here ...
```

If Slingshot is not behaving correctly, see the troubleshooting steps in the main README. I expect
that a common cause of problems will be that the server can't find the config YAML, or that it is
not processing the `includeDirs` correctly. Always check the log file (see readme), which contains
a large amount of information.
